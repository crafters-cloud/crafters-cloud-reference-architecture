# How to Scaffold a New Feature

1. Navigate to the _scripts_ solution folder.
2. Execute [_new-feature.ps1_](../../scripts/new-feature.ps1) from the root of the solution folder.  
   *(In Rider, you can do this by double-clicking on the script if you have the [Powershell](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10249-powershell) plugin installed.)*
3. Provide the singular and plural names of the new feature (e.g., _Order_ and _Orders_ or _Mouse_ and _Mice_).
4. Follow the instructions written in the script (manual adjustments may be needed).
